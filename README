BIBOS HACKS

This repo contains various scripts that I have hacked/copy-pasted together for the Aarhus Public Libraries version of Ubuntu called BibOS

At the momenet BibOS is based on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, so the scripts should work on a system based on that.

The names of the scripts almost always give away what they are intended to do. :)

I've tried keeping the repo (not the code) sort of tidy, but you will surely find files (like the utility scripts) that you won't need.

Feel free to use any and/or all scripts for personal or commercial use. If you don't give me credit, I'll think you're a dick, but that's probably all that's gonna happen.
